**On-Premise** - All servers, network devices, and other infrastructure are located on company property

- All equipment is purchased and owned by the company using at
- Company is responsible for the necessary space, power, and cooling

**Co-Location** - Data Centers that rent out space for customers to put their infrastructure

- Data Center providers the space, electricity, and cooling
- The servers, network devices, etc are still the responsibility of the end customer.  Although they are not located on the customer premise.

##### Cloud-Computing

Model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable  computing resources (network, server, storage) that can be rapidly  provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  This cloud model is composed of five essential characterizes, three service models, and four deployment models.  

5 Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
1. On Demand Serf Service
2. Broad Network Access
3. Resource Pooling
4. Rapid Elasicity
5. Measured Service

3 Service Models
1. Saas - Software as a Service
	1. GSuite
2. PaaS - Platform as a Service 
	1. Google App Engine
3. IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
	1. AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine

4 Deployment Models
1. Private Cloud
2. Community Cloud
3. Public Cloud
4. Hybrid Cloud

Benefits of Cloud Computing

**Cost** - Reduced Cost

**Global Scale** - Cloud services can scale globally a a rapid pace.  Service can be setup and offered to customers from a geographic location close to them

**Speed/Agility** - Services provided on-demand and vast amounts of resources can be deployed in minutes

**Productivity** -  Cloud services remove the need for many time consuming tasks such as procuring physicals servers, racking them, cabling, installing, and updating operating systems.  

**Reliability** - Backups in the cloud are very easy to perform.  Data can be mirrored in different geographical site to support disaster recovery


**Connecting to Cloud Resources**
- Private WAN
- Internet
- IPsec VPN Tunnel
