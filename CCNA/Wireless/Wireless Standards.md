##### 802.11r - Fast Transition Roaming

IEEE 802.11r specifies fast [Basic Service Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Service_Set "Basic Service Set") (BSS) transitions between access points by redefining the security key negotiation protocol, allowing both the negotiation and requests for wireless resources (similar to [RSVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Reservation_Protocol "Resource Reservation Protocol") but defined in [802.11e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11e "802.11e")) to occur in parallel.
##### 802.11k - Assisted Roaming

Meant to improve traffic distribution if the AP having the strongest signal is loaded to its full capacity, a wireless device is connected to one of the underutilized APs

##### 802.11v - Battery saving

Network assisted Power Savings - Helps clients to improve battery life by enabling them to sleep longer. For example, mobile devices use a certain amount of idle period to ensure that they remain connected to access points and therefore consume more power when performing the following tasks in a wireless network.

Network assisted Roaming - Enables the WLAN to send messages to associated clients, for better APs to associate with clients. This is useful for both load balancing and in directing poorly connected clients.
##### 802.11w - Provide MFP (Management Frame Protection)

Protect frames sent after key establishment
